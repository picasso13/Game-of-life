# Game-of-life
The Game of Life, invented by John Conway in 1970, known as a cellular automaton, implemented in C. 
Conway’s set of rules are summarized as: 
1. A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies. 
2. A live cell with more than three live neighbors also dies. 
3. A live cell with exactly two or three live neighbors lives. 
4. A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive

These rules calculate the state of a cell in the next generation as a function of the states of its neighboring cells in the current generation. In a 2-D world, a cell’s neighbors are the 8 cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally adjacent to that cell.
